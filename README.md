# Diffusion Models Minicourse (SBBD 2025)

Welcome to the repository for the **Diffusion Models Minicourse** presented at the Simpósio Brasileiro de Banco de Dados (SBBD) 2025.

## About the Minicourse
- **Event:** SBBD (Simpósio Brasileiro de Banco de Dados) 2025
- **Duration:** 4 hours
- **Paper:** A written paper accompanies this minicourse and is currently awaiting publication.
- **Presentation:** The minicourse includes a presentation in the format of slides.

## Repository Purpose
The main content of this repository is to provide the hands-on part of the minicourse. You will find practical Jupyter Notebooks that guide you through the implementation and experimentation with diffusion models.

## Notebooks
This repository contains three main notebooks:

1. **From Scratch: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model**
	- Step-by-step implementation of a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) from scratch.
2. **From Scratch: Score-Based Model**
	- Step-by-step implementation of a score-based generative model from scratch.
3. **High-Level Implementation with Diffusers**
	- Practical usage and customization of diffusion models using the Hugging Face `diffusers` library.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository.
- Open the notebooks in your preferred Jupyter environment.
- Follow the instructions in each notebook to run the code and explore diffusion models.
